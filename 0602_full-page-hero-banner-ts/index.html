              Lessons aren't just for school; we learn every time that we navigate new waters at home or at work.<br />
              So it's good that there are so many pottery, language or creative writing classes to cater to us.<br />
              These diversions can be fun and fulfilling ─ and they keep our minds active and receptive.

              It sounds twee but the evidence firmly suggests that it's good for mental and physical heath.<br />
              Whether it's a morning jog around Tokyo's Yoyogi Park or 20 minutes sitting with a paperback under an elm at the end of the road,<br/>
              nature can nurture us, whether of not we're in a city.

              Sustainability can mean different things.<br />
              It's great that you bought a chair made out of a plastic that can be recycled but terrible that you'll need to buy another<br />
              when it breaks in two weeks.<br />
              Surround yourself with things that you see value in and are built for the long haul.

              Inspiration is everywhere and small changes to our behaviour and attitude make a difference.<br />
              Half-formed thoughts tapped on phones are rarely revisited and don't stick with us in a meaningful way.<br />
              The world is a wondrous place with lots to see.<br />
              All that's left to do is take note.

              Basil for that window-box? A box hedge for the garden? A lemon tree for the balcony?<br />
              Fostering a living thing from seed is rewarding but takes patience and pluck.<br />
              It's good to grow and, in some small way, get back to the land.<br />
              Cultivation comes in many forms.
